## Specification 1:

### 1) Average Waiting Time:
- The average waiting time in the given test case is 2.33 seconds. With infinite baristas, the average waiting time could be reduced to 1 second, as each coffee would be prepared 1 second after the order is placed.

### 2) Incomplete Orders:
- In the provided test case, one coffee is wasted (customer 3 leaves before receiving their order). 

## Specification 2:

### 1) Minimizing Incomplete Orders:

#### 1.1) Order Cancellation:
- Allow customers to cancel their orders to prevent incomplete orders and enhance customer satisfaction.
#### 1.2)Order Confirmation Times:
- Provide customers with accurate order confirmation times.
- Adjust estimated preparation times based on order complexity and available resources.

#### 1.3) Priority Handling for Limited Toppings:
- Implement a priority system for orders with toppings in limited supply. Give preference to customers choosing more abundant toppings.


### 2) Ingredient Replenishment:

#### 2.1) Order Priority:
- Adjust the order acceptance/rejection process to prioritize orders with the least time to make when multiple orders arrive simultaneously. This maximizes customer satisfaction within the available machine working time.

#### 2.2) Real-time Supplier Integration:
- Trigger automatic replenishment orders when ingredients are depleted.

#### 2.3) Dynamic Order Acceptance:
- Modify the order acceptance algorithm to consider real-time ingredient availability. If an ingredient is out of stock, inform the customer promptly.

### 3) Unserviced Orders:

#### 3.1) Optimized Machine Utilization:
- Implement an algorithm to optimize the allocation of orders to machines, considering factors such as preparation time, machine availability, and order urgency.

#### 3.2) Customer Wait-Time Communication:
- Communicate estimated wait times to customers during order placement for transparency. This allows customers to make informed decisions and potentially modify their orders based on the communicated wait times.

#### 3.3) Efficient Order Queue Management:
- Implement an optimized order queue management system.
- Consider order complexity, available resources, and estimated preparation times.
- Prioritize simpler orders during peak hours for enhanced order turnover.

#### 3.4) Real-time Order Tracking:
- Introduce a real-time order tracking system for customers.
- Send automated updates on order status and expected wait times.

#### 3.5) Capacity Planning:
- Conduct regular capacity assessments to determine peak hours.
- Allocate additional resources during peak times.
- Adjust staffing levels based on historical order data and customer footfall.

#### 3.6) Pre-ordering Options:
- Encourage pre-ordering for customers during busy hours.
- Offer incentives for customers opting for pre-ordering.
